## What is it?
This is a demo of Core ML ðŸ¤–. Simply drag your favorite anime wallpapers, and the machine learning module will automatically recognize the daylight condition (whether day or night) of the image, and change your wallpaper accordingly at different times of a day.

## How to use?
- You can compile and run the sources directly.
- Or you can download [releases](https://github.com/msztech/Dynamic-Day-Night-Anime-Wallpaper/releases) directly
- When running: Select a folder that contains only the images (with no sub-directories) -> Wait for ML to recognize -> Correct the wrong recognitions by clicking on the image name -> And, Minimize the program (do not close the window)

## What does the Machine Learning Module recognize?
It's trained with a limited set of features in the anime wallpaper, like the sky, the cloud, and nearby environment to help the machine differentiate between daytime and night.

## Views

### [ViewController.swift](https://github.com/msztech/Dynamic-Day-Night-Anime-Wallpaper/blob/master/Dynamic%20Anime%20Wallpaper/ViewController.swift)
Presents the user basic interface and file selector to allow users to choose a path. After a path is chosen, it will proform a ML Vision request for the images, and show a progress bar.

### [confirmView.swift](https://github.com/msztech/Dynamic-Day-Night-Anime-Wallpaper/blob/master/Dynamic%20Anime%20Wallpaper/confirmView.swift)
This view shows the result of the ML Vision recognition through a TableView. You can click on the cell (image name) to switch its status (day/ night)

## Why make this app?
I make a lot of other apps and have projects. This project is built just for fun and for experimenting the possible applications of Core ML.
